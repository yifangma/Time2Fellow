This repository contains the code and data used to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Collaborating with Former Fellows Shorten the Road to ACM Fellowship".


## Datasets
This repository includes the following datasets:

- 'ACM fellow characteristic.dta': This dataset contains the characteristics of ACM fellows, used to conduct the linear regressions. 

- 'ACM_fellow_electron_year_percentage.xlsx': This dataset describes the percentage of new electees who have co-authored with former ACM fellows each year since 1995. It is used to reproduce the result shown in Fig 1(a). 

- 'ACM_fellow_characteristic_reproduce.xlsx': This dataset also contains the characteristics of ACM fellows, used to reproduce the results shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2. 


## Code
The code for this project is organized into several scripts, each serving a specific purpose:

- 'ACM fellow characteristic.do': This Stata script contains commands to analyze the `ACM fellow characteristic.dta` dataset.

- 'code.ipynb': This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code to analyze the `ACM_fellow_electron_year_percentage.xlsx` and `ACM_fellow_characteristic_reproduce.xlsx` datasets.


### Code Structure

- 'ACM fellow characteristic.do': [Provides linear regression results using Stata].
- 'code.ipynb': [Reproduces results shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 using Python].
